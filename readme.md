# Helper Shell Scripts

Some of this functionality has been taken over by bunches.

I mostly use for quickly making a new note.

## New Note

```shell

newnote "blogx rpi custom vision part 1"

```

Creates a new file named:
2020-03-20-blogx-rpi-custom-vision-part-1

with a first line of

\# # blogx rpi custom vision part 1

## New Work Note

```shell

newworknote "Riley 1:1"

```

Creates a new file named:
2020-03-20-riley-1-1.md

with a first line of

\# Riley 1:1

## New Go project

```shell

newgo customvisionservice

```

...you get the picture
